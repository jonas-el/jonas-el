- Hi, Iâ€™m Jonas
- I want to practice my coding skills and become a software engineer in the long run.
- Currently I am learning flutter. My background is engineering, so I have a lot of expieriences with matlab and some expieriences with c++ and python. 
- I am the type of person who loves to start and hates to complete projects. Mostly because at some point I will feel that I lack the necessary skills
- as wells as the ability to acquire them in a reasonable time frame.
